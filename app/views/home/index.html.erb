            <p> I am a graduate student in Tikhomirov Lab at Berkeley EECS. I started my undergraduate degree in
                economics,
                transitioned to computer science second year, electrical engineering third, and by the fourth year I
                found
                myself
                synthesizing nucleic acid nanostrucres in lab, which I continue to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am broadly interested in self-assembling systems, molecular programming and computation, nucleic acid
                and
                protein
                folding, sequencing technologies, and anything and everything in the nano world.
